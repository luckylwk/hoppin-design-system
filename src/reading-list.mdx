# Get Started

## The Orbiit Design System is based on:

- Styled-System for token-based theming
- Styled-Components for CSS-in-JS (see below)

## TODO / Discussion

- styled-components forward all props to the rendered HTML (using a simple whitelist) resulting in lots of warnings in the console and bad HTML.
  - should we use emotion instead?
  - same API when using emotion/styled https://emotion.sh/docs/styled
  - extra features with babel plugin: https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-emotion
    - harder to use with create-react-app, as you need to change babel config.
- do we want to use something like [Reakit](https://reakit.io/) for accessibility?

## Philosophy

_A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications._

Goal to be as useful as [Shopify Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/button#navigation) or [Atlasian AtlasKit](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/core/button):

- **simple onboarding** (intro, get started, philosophy, tooling, ...)

- **tokens** (variables)

  - token names reflect intention/meaning, not it's visual style (~min 10 in video)
    - `orbiitTurquoise` => `brandPrimary`
    - `red` => `danger`

- **components** with docs on props, usage, best practices
  - When you need a new component, build it locally in the app first, test it, and if it works well, push it upstream into the design-system.
  - Flat Component Hierarchies! [https://varun.ca/flattening-deep-hierarchies-of-components/](https://varun.ca/flattening-deep-hierarchies-of-compo)

Guiding principles for components:

- **Keep layout separate**

  - Design components to only care about itself, not the layout. So say a box should always fill it's container with `flex-grow: 1`

- **Respond to context**

  - e.g. colors not hardcoded, currentColor
  - for us: don't use pink, turqoise, etc. use brandPrimary, brandAccent, etc.

- **Document Assumptions**
  - for us: use PropTypes or TypeScript, add inline doc comments explaining props.

## Setup

- Independent Repo, later npm module
- All apps depend on design-system module
- co-locate component and examples?

  - folder structure like:

    - `components`
      - `Button`
        - `index.js` - all the exports
        - `Button.js` - component
        - `Button.md` or `readme.md` (examples for design-system)

  - inline [jsdoc](https://jsdoc.app/) comments for props, etc

  - Open for modification

    - for now, fork into local, test, commit to design-system later?
    - maybe later: [Override Pattern](https://medium.com/@dschnr/better-reusable-react-components-with-the-overrides-pattern-9eca2339f646) as also used by [Uber Base Web]() and described in [Gergely Nemeth's article on design systems](https://blog.risingstack.com/design-systems-react/)

  - [on theming](https://jxnblk.com/blog/iterations-on-a-theme/)
  - [on styles in react in general](https://jxnblk.com/blog/patterns-for-style-composition-in-react/) which lead to:

* **Styled-System**

  - **[fantastic article](https://varun.ca/styled-system/) by Varun Vachhar** explaining all the thinking behind it and how it ties together lots of the above thinking.
  - Alan B Smith from Sendgrid on [Building Better Component Libraries with Styled System](https://medium.com/styled-components/build-better-component-libraries-with-styled-system-4951653d54ee)
  - note: styled-system calls the object holding all the tokens `theme` other places call it `tokens` or whatnot.
