# Markdown

The Markdown Component is used to render markdown content. It uses the components defined in HDS, as far as possible.

## Props

<Props of={Text} />
Props table might not render due to a [bug in docz](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/issues/777)

Just has one prop. Children which should be a MD string.

Because this in MD inside JSX inside MD, the demo is more complex than it's actual use. :)

To demo, type some MD below, or copy this bit in:

```
# Headings

Some lorem ipsum paragraphs, ...

### Smaller heading

#### all of them, actually

You can also [link](/components/Link) things.

![Add Images with standard MD](http://placekitten.com/200/300)
![!Add Images with a caption, by prefixing the alt text with a !](http://placekitten.com/200/300)

- Lists are fun
- All the bullets
- ðŸŽ¯

1. Give
1. Me
1. Numbers ðŸ’¯

```

<Playground>
  <Markdown>{`**Type here...** between the backticks if you're using inline MD`}</Markdown>
</Playground>

You can also pass children as a string:

<Playground>
{() => {
  const mdstring = `This is a _great_ way to render content consistently with Hoppin Design.\n\n **Especially** if fetched from a DB.`;
  return (<div>
  <Markdown>{mdstring}</Markdown>

or like this:

  <Markdown children={mdstring}/>
  </div>
  );
  }}
</Playground>

## Images

To allow MD images to have a caption, not only an alt text, we expanded valid markdown slightly.
The same way an `!` turns a link `[label](url)` into an image`![alt](src)`, you can turn the standard alt text `![alt](src)` into a caption `![!caption](src)`

```
![Add Images with standard MD](http://placekitten.com/200/200)
![!Add Images with a caption, by prefixing the alt text with a "!"](http://placekitten.com/200/202)
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const altImage = `![Add Images with standard MD](http://placekitten.com/200/200)`;
    const captionImage = `![!Add Images with a caption, by prefixing the alt text with a "!"](http://placekitten.com/200/202)`;
    return (
    <Box textAlign="center">
      <Markdown>{`${altImage}

      ${captionImage}
      `}</Markdown>
    </Box>
    );
    }}

</Playground>
