# Markdown

The Markdown Component is used to render markdown content. It uses the components defined in HDS, as far as possible.

## Props

<Props of={Text} />
Props table might not render due to a [bug in docz](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/issues/777)

Just has one prop. Children which should be a MD string.

Because this in MD inside JSX inside MD, the demo is more complex than it's actual use. :)

To demo, type some MD below, or copy this bit in:

```
# Headings

Some lorem ipsum paragraphs, ...

### Smaller heading

#### all of them, actually

You can also [link](/components/Link) things.
```

<Playground>
  <Markdown>{`**Type here...** between the backticks if you're using inline MD`}</Markdown>
</Playground>

You can also pass children as a string:

<Playground>
{() => {
  const mdstring = `This is a _great_ way to render DB content consistently with Hoppin Design.\n **Especially** if fetched from a DB.`;
  return (<div>
  <Markdown>{mdstring}</Markdown>

or like this:

  <Markdown children={mdstring}/>
  </div>
  );
  }}
</Playground>
