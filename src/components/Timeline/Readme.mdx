# Timeline

You should not need to import Steps individually.

## Props

- `steps`: array of steps objects:

  ```
  {
      title: 'Kick Off',
      description:
      'A 1:1 introductory meeting where the host sets the context for the day.',
      image: {
      mobile: 'https://picsum.photos/320/240',
      desktop: 'https://picsum.photos/1200/800',
      },
  }
  ```

  the image key can also contain a plain string, rather than an object with mobile and desktop keys.

- `nextLabel`: Optional string to be used as the label for the "Next" button
- `minHeight`: Optional. By default the Timeline will be min 500px high and scale to get bigger to fit the content.
  set minHeight prop to set a specific height on the container
- any other prop that `<Flex>` can have (styled-system) will be forwarded to the container Flex
- `onStepChange`: callback that returns step object, useful to set background of `<Banner>` if used together.
- `hideStepImageOnDesktop`: hide images in the individual `Step` components on larger screens. To be uses with `onStepChange`, defaults to `false`

## Usage

`Timeline` renders just the timeline, responsive to the screen size.

      }
    ];

    return (
    <Container bg='neutrals.base'>
      <Timeline
        steps={timelineMockData}
        minHeight={800}
        nextLabel={`There's more...`}
      />
    </Container>
    );

}}

## Usage inside Banner

Timeline plays well with a [Banner](components/Banner) component to create a full-width section.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const timelineMockData = [
      {
        title: "Kick Off",
        description:
          "A 1:1 introductory meeting where the host sets the context for the day.",
        image: {
          mobile: "https://picsum.photos/320/240",
          desktop: "https://picsum.photos/1200/800"
        }
      },
      {
        title: "Office Tour",
        description:
          "You get a full tour of your host’s office, which is half the fun when it’s a really different environment! ",
        image: {
          mobile: "https://picsum.photos/320/241",
          desktop: "https://picsum.photos/1200/801"
        }
      },
      {
        title: "Meetings",
        description:
          "An opportunity to attend meetings, listen in on calls and really see your host in action! ",
        image: {
          mobile: "https://picsum.photos/320/242",
          desktop: "https://picsum.photos/1200/802"
        }
      },
      {
        title: "Lunch / Networking Event",
        description:
          "Whether a team lunch, or a networking event, hosts will use every opportunity to engage you with the wider team and their industry.",
        image: {

          desktop: "https://picsum.photos/1200/803"
        }
      },
      {

        image: "https://picsum.photos/320/241"
      }
    ];

    const [image, setImage ] = React.useState(timelineMockData[0].image)

    return (
    <Banner height='auto' shadow='top' backgroundImage={image.desktop && image.mobile ? image.desktop : image}>
      <Container>
        <Heading color='white'>What can you expect from the experience?</Heading>
        <Lede>We take pride in facilitating authentic experiences, where every day is different and it varies from industry to industry. Where possible, the hosts aim to ensure the following:</Lede>
        <Timeline
          steps={timelineMockData}
          nextLabel={`There's more...`}
          onStepChange={(step) => {setImage(step.image)}}
          hideStepImageOnDesktop={true}
        />
      </Container>
    </Banner>
    );
