# Timeline

You should not need to import Steps individually.

## Props

- `steps`: array of steps objects:

  ```
  {
      title: 'Kick Off',
      description:
      'A 1:1 introductory meeting where the host sets the context for the day.',
      image: {
      mobile: 'https://picsum.photos/320/240',
      desktop: 'https://picsum.photos/1200/800',
      },
  }
  ```

  the image key can also contain a plain string, rather than an object with mobile and desktop keys.

- `title` and `subtitle`: Optional strings to set a title at the top of the section.
- `nextLabel`: Optional string to be used as the label for the "Next" button
- `minHeight`: Optional. By default the Timeline will be min 500px high and scale to get bigger to fit the content.
  set minHeight prop to set a specific height on the container

- `p` : overwrite default padding of the container FlexBox
- `bg`: overwrite the default bg color of the container Flexbox
- any other prop that `<Flex>` can have (styled-system) will be forwarded to the container Flex
