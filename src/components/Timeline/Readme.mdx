# Timeline

You should not need to import Steps individually.

## Props

- `steps`: array of steps objects:

  ```
  {
      title: 'Kick Off',
      description:
      'A 1:1 introductory meeting where the host sets the context for the day.',
      bullet: '1',
      image: {
        mobile: 'https://picsum.photos/320/240',
        desktop: 'https://picsum.photos/1200/800',
      },
  }
  ```

  - The `image` key can also contain a plain string, rather than an object with mobile and desktop keys.
  - If no `image` is set, it won't render.
  - `bullet` is optional and can contain a string or small React Element to be centered in the bullet

- `nextLabel`: Optional string to be used as the label for the "Next" button
- `minHeight`: Optional. By default the Timeline will be min 500px high and scale to get bigger to fit the content.
  set minHeight prop to set a specific height on the container
- any other prop that `<Flex>` can have (styled-system) will be forwarded to the container Flex
- `onStepChange`: callback that returns step object, useful to set background of `<Banner>` if used together.
- `hideStepImageOnDesktop`: hide images in the individual `Step` components on larger screens. To be uses with `onStepChange`, defaults to `false`
- `bulletSize`: change the size of the bullets, defaults to small. (use any tokens.size)
- `showTrack`: show the "train track" behind the bullets. Defaults to `true`

## Usage

`Timeline` renders just the timeline, responsive to the screen size.

  {() => {
    const timelineMockData = [
      {
        title: "Kick Off",
        description:
          "A 1:1 introductory meeting where the host sets the context for the day.",
        image: {
          mobile: "https://picsum.photos/320/240",
          desktop: "https://picsum.photos/1200/800"
        }
      },
      {
        title: "Office Tour",
        description:
          "You get a full tour of your host’s office, which is half the fun when it’s a really different environment! ",

          mobile: "https://picsum.photos/320/241",
          desktop: "https://picsum.photos/1200/800"
        }
      },
      {
        title: "Meetings",
        description:
          "An opportunity to attend meetings, listen in on calls and really see your host in action! ",
        image: {
          mobile: "https://picsum.photos/320/242",

        }

        description:
          "Whether a team lunch, or a networking event, hosts will use every opportunity to engage you with the wider team and their industry.",

          "Each experience ends with a debrief and it’s your time to ask any final questions and share highlights of the day.",
        image: "https://picsum.photos/320/241"
      }
    ];

    return (
    <Container bg='neutrals.base' color='white'>
      <Timeline
        steps={timelineMockData}
        minHeight={800}
        nextLabel={`There's more...`}
      />
    </Container>
    );

}}

</Playground>

## Usage inside Banner

Timeline plays well with a [Banner](components/Banner) component to create a full-width section.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const timelineMockData = [
      {
        title: "Kick Off",
        description:
          "A 1:1 introductory meeting where the host sets the context for the day.",
        image: {
          mobile: "https://picsum.photos/320/240",
          desktop: "https://picsum.photos/1200/800"
        }
      },
      {
        title: "Office Tour",
        description:
          "You get a full tour of your host’s office, which is half the fun when it’s a really different environment! ",
        image: {
          mobile: "https://picsum.photos/320/241",
          desktop: "https://picsum.photos/1200/801"
        }
      },
      {
        title: "Meetings",
        description:
          "An opportunity to attend meetings, listen in on calls and really see your host in action! ",
        image: {
          mobile: "https://picsum.photos/320/242",
          desktop: "https://picsum.photos/1200/802"
        }
      },
      {
        title: "Lunch / Networking Event",
        description:
          "Whether a team lunch, or a networking event, hosts will use every opportunity to engage you with the wider team and their industry.",
        image: {
          mobile: "https://picsum.photos/320/241",
          desktop: "https://picsum.photos/1200/803"
        }
      },
      {
        title: "An Independent Task",
        description:
          "A chance to really get hands on with your host’s job and try doing it yourself. ",
        image: {
          mobile: "https://picsum.photos/320/240",
          desktop: "https://picsum.photos/1200/804"
        }
      },
      {
        title: "Wrap Up",
        description:
          "Each experience ends with a debrief and it’s your time to ask any final questions and share highlights of the day.",
        image: "https://picsum.photos/320/241"
      }
    ];

    const [image, setImage ] = React.useState(timelineMockData[0].image)

    return (
    <Banner height='auto' shadow='top' backgroundImage={image.desktop && image.mobile ? image.desktop : image}>
      <Container>
        <Heading color='white'>What can you expect from the experience?</Heading>
        <Lede>We take pride in facilitating authentic experiences, where every day is different and it varies from industry to industry. Where possible, the hosts aim to ensure the following:</Lede>
        <Timeline
          color='white'
          steps={timelineMockData}
          nextLabel={`There's more...`}
          onStepChange={(step) => {setImage(step.image)}}
          hideStepImageOnDesktop={true}
        />
      </Container>
    </Banner>
    );

}}

</Playground>

## Custom Bullets, hide track

To customise the timeline you can supply custom bullets in the steps array by setting the bullet key in each step object.
And to hide the "track" behind the bullets, simply set `showTrack={false}`

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const timelineMockData = [
      {
        bullet: '1',
        title: "How to be a great host",
        description:
          "Learn the basics of being the host of a shadowing experience."
      },
      {
        bullet: '2',
        title: "Build your profile",
        description:
          "Build your profile by giving us a information about you and your organization."
      },
      {
        bullet: '3',
        title: "Meetings",
        description:
          "An opportunity to attend meetings, listen in on calls and really see your host in action!"
      }
    ];

    return (
    <Container bg='neutrals.base' color='white'>
      <Timeline
        steps={timelineMockData}
        nextLabel={`There's more...`}
        bulletSize='large'
        showTrack={false}
      />
    </Container>
    );

}}

</Playground>

## Disable user interactions

Im some cases you might want to show the progress, but don't allow the user to navigate through the steps.
For example when used together with [SteppedJSONForm](/components/SteppedJSONForm).

You can disable user interactions and hide the next buttons by setting `interactive={false}`

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const timelineMockData = [
      {
        bullet: '1',
        title: "How to be a great host",
        description:
          "Learn the basics of being the host of a shadowing experience."
      },
      {
        bullet: '2',
        title: "Build your profile",
        description:
          "Build your profile by giving us a information about you and your organization."
      },
      {
        bullet: '3',
        title: "Meetings",
        description:
          "An opportunity to attend meetings, listen in on calls and really see your host in action!"
      }
    ];

    return (
    <Container bg='neutrals.base' color='white'>
      <Timeline
        steps={timelineMockData}
        bulletSize='large'
        showTrack={false}
        interactive={false}
      />
    </Container>
    );

}}

</Playground>

## Colors

The inactive step headings inherit the color from the parant components. Set color either on timeline or a parent element to change it.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const timelineMockData = [
      {
        bullet: '1',
        title: "How to be a great host",
        description:
          "Learn the basics of being the host of a shadowing experience."
      },
      {
        bullet: '2',
        title: "Build your profile",
        description:
          "Build your profile by giving us a information about you and your organization."
      },
      {
        bullet: '3',
        title: "Meetings",
        description:
          "An opportunity to attend meetings, listen in on calls and really see your host in action!"
      }
    ];

    return (
    <Container bg='neutrals.lightest' color='neutrals.light'>
      <Timeline
        steps={timelineMockData}
        bulletSize='large'
        showTrack={false}
        interactive={false}
      />
    </Container>
    );

}}

</Playground>

## Initialise with specific active step

To define which step is active before the user starts to click on things, set `initAtStep` to the array index of the step you want to jump to.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const timelineMockData = [
      {
        bullet: '1',
        title: "How to be a great host",
        description:
          "Learn the basics of being the host of a shadowing experience."
      },
      {
        bullet: '2',
        title: "Build your profile",
        description:
          "Build your profile by giving us a information about you and your organization."
      },
      {
        bullet: '3',
        title: "Meetings",
        description:
          "An opportunity to attend meetings, listen in on calls and really see your host in action!"
      }
    ];

    return (
    <Container bg='neutrals.lightest' color='neutrals.light'>
      <Timeline
        steps={timelineMockData}
        bulletSize='large'
        showTrack={false}
        interactive={false}
        initAtStep={2}
      />
    </Container>
    );

}}

</Playground>
