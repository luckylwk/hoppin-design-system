# Link

Link needs `react-router-dom` as a peer dependency. So it will pick up withever version of react-router-dom you're using in the app.
This is to avoid version clashes. Hoppin Design System does not bundle `react-router-dom`, it's up to you to provide it in your app as a dependency.

Use the `as` prop to replace the react-router-dom `<Link/>` with a standard `<a/>` tag for external links.
All demos here use`as="a"` because react-router-dom `<Link/>` can't be rendendered outside a `<Router>` component.

<Props of={Link} />

## Standard Link

This is your standard link. It can have the same `context` prop as [Button](/components/Button) components.

<Playground>
  <Link as="a">Click me</Link>

  <Link as="a" context="hopper">
    Hopper
  </Link>
  <Link as="a" context="host">
    Host
  </Link>
  <Link as="a" context="danger">
    Danger
  </Link>
</Playground>

## Links in context

Link are displayed as `inline-block` by default, so they nest in to any body copy, like the [Paragraph](/components/Paragraph).
