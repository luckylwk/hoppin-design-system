# Link

`ALink` and `UnstyledALink` are rendering as `a` tags.

`ALink` has an underline, where as unstyled link will inherit the styles from it's parent, but also accepts basic styled-system props.

To trigger navigation within the app, use `RoutedLink` or `UnstyledRoutedLink`.

`RoutedLink` needs `react-router-dom` as a peer dependency. So it will pick up withever version of react-router-dom you're using in the app through the react context API.
This is to avoid version clashes. Hoppin Design System does not bundle `react-router-dom`, it's up to you to provide it in your app as a dependency.

All demos here use the un-routed versions because react-router-dom `<Link/>` can't be rendendered outside a `<Router>` component.

> Routed (internal) Links use react-router-dom-style `to` props, rather than HTML style href.<br/>
> Unrouted (external) ALinks use `href`, they are simple `a` tags.

### Note

If using the `<Link>` component internally, set the `to` prop:

```
<Link to='/my/app/route'>
```

If using the `<Link>` component externalls with `as="a"`, set the `href` and `target` props:

```
<Link href='https://gohoppin.com' target="_blank">
```

<Props of={Link} />

## Standard Link (Routed and Unrouted)

This is your standard link. It can have the same `context` prop as [Button](/components/Button) components.

<Playground>
  <Link as="a">Click me</Link>

  <Link context="hopper">
    Hopper
  </Link>
  <Link context="host">
    Host
  </Link>
  <Link context="danger">
    Danger
  </Link>
</Playground>

## Links in context

Link are displayed as `inline-block` by default, so they nest in to any body copy, like the [Paragraph](/components/Paragraph).

## Unstyled Links

Unstyled Links are identical with the normal link components, but remove any stuyling. No underline, no hover state.

    <Box margin='large' padding='large' bg='white'>
      Clickable Box
    </Box>
    </UnstyledALink>
  </Box>
</Playground>

UnstyledALink takes a `color` prop.
It also accepts basic `display` and `flexbox (child)` props and can be used like a `Box` that links to something.
