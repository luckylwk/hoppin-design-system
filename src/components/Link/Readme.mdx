# Link

## Core Components

There are four basic link components:

`LinkStyled` and `LinkUnstyled` are rendering as standard `a` tags.
`RoutedLinkStyled` and `RoutedLinkUnstyled` are rendering as `react-router-dom/Link`

To trigger navigation within the app, use a `RoutedLink`.

`Styled` links have an underline, where as unstyled links will inherit the styles from it's parent, but also accepts basic styled-system props.

> `RoutedLink` and `RoutedLinkUnstyled` need `react-router-dom` as a peer dependency. So it will pick up withever version of react-router-dom you're using in the app through the react context API.
> This is to avoid version clashes. Orbiit Design System does not bundle `react-router-dom`, it's up to you to provide it in your app as a dependency.

All demos here use the un-routed versions because react-router-dom `<LinkUnstyled/>` can't be rendendered outside a `<Router>` component.

> Routed (internal) Links use react-router-dom-style `to` props, rather than HTML style href.<br/>
> Unrouted (external) Links use `href`, they are simple `a` tags.
> All other props are the same between routed and unrouted links.

## Magic Links

The above core components are great for readability of the code and to make explicit decisions, but can be difficult to work with when you're rendering dynamic links.
the `<Link />` component is a convenience-wrapper around the four components above and will automagically render the appropriate link.

`<Link to='/my/app/route'>` will render as `<RoutedLinkStyled to='/my/app/route'>`

`<Link unstyled={true} to='/my/app/route'>` will render as `<RoutedLinkUnstyled to='/my/app/route'>`

`<Link to='http://example.com/'>` will render as `<LinkStyled href='http://example.com/'>`

`<Link unstyled={true} to='http://example.com/'>` will render as `<LinkStyled href='http://example.com/'>`

## Styled Link (Routed and Unrouted)

This is your standard link. It can have the same `context` prop as [Button](/components/Button) components.

<Props of={LinkUnstyled} />

<Playground>
  <LinkStyled>Click me</LinkStyled>

  <LinkStyled context="shadower">
    shadower
  </LinkStyled>
  <LinkStyled context="host">
    Host
  </LinkStyled>
  <LinkStyled context="danger">
    Danger
  </LinkStyled>
</Playground>

## Links in context

Link are displayed as `inline-block` by default, so they nest in to any body copy, like the [Paragraph](/components/Paragraph).

## Unstyled Links

Unstyled Links are identical with the normal link components, but remove any stuyling. No underline, no hover state.

<Props of={LinkUnstyled} />

    <Box margin='large' padding='large' bg='white'>
      Clickable Box
    </Box>
    </LinkUnstyled>
  </Box>
</Playground>

LinkUnstyled takes a `color` prop.
It also accepts basic `display` and `flexbox (child)` props and can be used like a `Box` that links to something.
