# Spacing

## Space

The space key contains a scale to be used for `margin` and `padding` [styled-system props](https://styled-system.com/api#space).

The examples use `padding` in dark to demonstrate the space scale.

<SpaceSwatches space={space} />

## Radii

The radii key contains a scale to be used for the `borderRadius` prop.

<RadiusSwatches radii={radii} />

## zIndices

To minimize random problems with z-index clashes, please set the z-indexes with the prop shorthand:

- `zIndex="farBack"` - very far in the background, e.g. background images
- `zIndex="back"` - just behind the normal content
- `zIndex="base"` - main page content
- `zIndex="front"` - slightly above the content, e.g. a highlighted Box,...
- `zIndex="nav"` - navigation bar, etc that should stay visible on scrolling
- `zIndex="overlay"` - modals, things that block the rest of the app.

## ContainerWidths

Only to be used with [Container](/components/Container). See the docs for the component.

## Breakpoints and Media Queries

All styles are defined mobile-first. Meaning the default styles are set for tiny (phone) screens and media queries are used to add specific styles for larger screens.

The [styled system docs on responsive styles](https://styled-system.com/responsive-styles) explain really well how this works.

If you need to access the breakpoints directly, they are available as `theme.breakpoints` in the theme object.

There are three breakpoints:
- `theme.breakpoints[0]` or `theme.breakpoints.small` - for huge phones or small tablets
- `theme.breakpoints[1]` or `theme.breakpoints.medium` - for tablets and smaller desktop windows
- `theme.breakpoints[2]` or `theme.breakpoints.large` - for iPad Pros and large desktop windows

For convenience, there's also a 'mediaQueries' object in the theme.

Use it like:

```
styled.div`
  ${/* default styles (mobile)*/}
  color: blue;

  ${/* get the media query for medium screens (desktop) and override styles */}

   ${({theme}) => theme.mediaQueries.medium} {
       color: red;
   }

  ${/* you can also use the array index [0,1,2] (below gets 2 / large) */}

   ${({theme}) => theme.mediaQueries[2]} {
       color: red;
   }
`
```
